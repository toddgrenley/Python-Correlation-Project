# Python-Correlation-Project

This project explores the Movie Industry data set from Kaggle. It uses Python with pandas and numpy to explore and clean the data, and then packages like seaborn to do some
compelling visualizations. These are used to draw conclusions as to what features of a movie have significant correlation, for example if a movie's budget is high, its gross
earnings tend to be high as well. Feel free to have a look and Happy Exploring!
